Yes, this is my initial commit.

I've been thinking about creating a diary-like blog for some time. The problem
is that sometimes I'm shy enough to suppress the desire of creating a blog and
lock this dream away in an empty, dark and quiet box in the attic. I hope today
is the day of the independence of my ideas and the death of this stupid
internal bullying.

I intent to write/share here anything I can think of: ideas, complaints,
experiences, complaints, computing stuff, complaints and probably a little bit
of complaint too. Yeah, I know, I complain a lot.

I don't expect anybody to like or follow this thing, I just hope I can still
make my writing skills grow a little bit. When I was young I loved writing but
the time and responsabilities made that go away somehow. I hope I can regain
that feeling someday. Let's see.

Regards.
