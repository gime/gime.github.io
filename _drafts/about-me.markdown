title: "About Me"
---

I think I should first start talking about me. This will give you a little
perspective of how I see things in life.

I've been a Christian pratically since I was born.

I live for my family, the second most important thing I have.

I have a wonderful wife, two children and I love being a father.

I work in a very large company, where I'm just a number, a code monkey, and I'm
not in any way used to this.

I travel for 3 hours a day to get to work, work for 9 and a half hours and have
only about an hour of personal time.

I love working with the tools I use at work (Linux, C++ and Python), but almost
all of them are more than 7 years old.

I have some quite excelent tech skills, but because my last boss threw me under
the bus due to his lack of leadership skills, my reputation with my current
boss is next to zero.

I love continuous improvement. My last three bosses love stagnation.

I stutter, don't have a high IQ and very frequently I'm ashamed of my lack of
intelligence or knowledge.

I'm paranoid.
